- Like you I
- love love, life, the sweet smell
- of things, the sky-blue
- landscape of January days.
- {:.indent-3}And my blood boils up
- {:.indent-4}and I laugh through eyes
- {:.indent-5}that have known the buds of tears.
- {:.indent-6}I believe the world is beautiful
- and that poetry, like bread, is for everyone.
- And that my veins donâ€™t end in me
- but in the unanimous blood
- of those who struggle for life,
- love,
- little things,
- landscape and bread,
- the poetry of everyone.
